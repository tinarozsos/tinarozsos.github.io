I was recently interviewed for a post on [CORE Econ](https://www.core-econ.org)'s blog.
Eileen Tipoe from the CORE Editorial Board, Joe Hasell from Our World in Data, and I as CORE's data editor talked about the CORE–OWiD partnership.
We talk about how we use OWiD's interactive charts in CORE textbooks, new OWiD features, and the challenges of collecting and maintaining up-to-date data in a rapidly changing world.
