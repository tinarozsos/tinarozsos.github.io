I lauched a new version of my website!

# Quarto

Previously run on Beautiful Jekyll and Rmarkdown, I have now transitioned to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
The website it still published via GitHub Pages, but now the [source code](https://github.com/tinarozsos/tinarozsos.github.io) is cleaner, with only the QMD files, SCSS stylesheet, and other assets in the repo.
The website is now also more mobile-friendly, and allows more features of Quarto.

# Visual identity

I got bored of the previous design, and wanted something more whimsical.
I also thought it would be good to highlight more of my work, especially my R projects.

Now the landing page features a set of cards directing to different parts of the website.
I introduced new pages to share news and updates from my work, and a portfolio of my R projects.
These pages will slowly be populated with content.
The cards themselves are illustrated with some of my own R-based generative art -- all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinarozsos/art).

I shifted the colour scheme to a colorful pastel palette, chose a new font set (Quicksand and Inter), and made use of icons for a bit of extra flair.
The header and footer color matches my newly painted walls -- gotta keep the visual identity consistent online and offline! (or maybe I just really like the color)

Anyway, so far I'm enjoying the new design, and there is certainly more to come.

# Credits

In addition to heavily relying on the [Quarto website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), the home page card setup was inspired by the websites of [Ella Kaye](https://ellakaye.co.uk/) and [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/).
And since my HTML and CSS skills are not quite aligned with the level of customisation I desire, chunks of the SCSS file and some of the HTML bits in the QMD files are the results of extensive back-and-forth chats with ChatGPT.
