One of my friends really likes the UK TV show *Taskmaster*, and so do I.
So when her birthday was coming up, I made her a fun game based on *Taskmaster* quotes in the best way I could think of: a Shiny app!

The game design is very simple.
There are 8 pairs of cards, face down in a grid.
The player must find all matching pairs by flipping over two cards at a time.
But instead of having pairs of identical images, the pairs are a quote, item, or action, and the person most closely associated with it.

While it's just about the simplest game imaginable in real life, implementing it as a Shiny app came with various challenges to get all mechanisms right.
At the same time, both the server logic and the *Taskmaster*-style theming proved to be great opportunities for some experimentation with Positron Assistant.

In addition, I could practice my web scraping skills by extracting quotes from the [Taskmaster Wiki](https://taskmaster.fandom.com/wiki/Taskmaster_Wiki) and had fun choosing my favorite [out-of-context quotes](https://www.instagram.com/taskmasternocontext/).
This was also my first time using Posit Connect Cloud instead of shinyapps.io, and I was very pleased with the experience.
