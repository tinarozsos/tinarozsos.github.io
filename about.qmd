::: {#header}
I am an applied microeconomist with an interest in the economics of
(higher) education.

I am currently a PhD student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands; my supervisors are Bas van der
Klaauw and Hessel Oosterbeek.
I completed the Economics Research Master of Tinbergen Institute, and received my Bachelor's degree from University College Roosevelt with a major in Economics, Data Science, and Statistics.
:::

Next to my PhD, I am a Graduate Fellow at the [University College Roosevelt Data Center](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/), where I work towards embedding data science into the curriculum and build (interactive) tools to aid data-driven decision-making across the college. I am also the Data Manager of [CORE Econ](https://www.core-econ.org/), where I am responsible for the data figures of multiple undergraduate economics textbooks.
