I am an applied microeconomist with an interest in the economics of
(higher) education.

I am currently a PhD student at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands; my supervisors are Bas van der
Klaauw and Hessel Oosterbeek.
I completed the Economics Research Master of Tinbergen Institute, and received my Bachelor's degree from University College Roosevelt with a major in Economics, Data Science, and Statistics.

I am a Graduate Fellow for the [University College Roosevelt Data
Center](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/) and the Data Manager for [CORE
Econ](https://www.core-econ.org/).
