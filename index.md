# About me

I am an applied microeconomist with an interest in the economics of
(higher) education. I am currently working on my MPhil at Tinbergen
Institute in the Netherlands; my thesis supervisors are Bas van der
Klaauw and Hessel Oosterbeek. I plan to start my PhD in Fall 2024.

I am also a Graduate Fellow for the [University College Roosevelt Data
Center](https://ucrdatacenter.github.io/) and the Data Manager for [CORE
Econ](https://www.core-econ.org/).
